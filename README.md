## Project Description
In this project, we focus on API Security by detecting anomalous access behaviors using classical machine learning techniques.

Modern applications rely heavily on APIs, making them attractive targets for attacks such as abuse, unauthorized access, credential misuse, and abnormal request patterns.
The objective of this project is to analyze API access logs and identify abnormal or suspicious behaviors that deviate from normal usage patterns.

This project is developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course and follows Path 2: Classical Machine Learning.


## Objectives
- Analyze API access behavior data
- Identify abnormal or suspicious API usage patterns
- Apply proper data preprocessing and normalization
- Train and compare classical machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Gain practical experience with a real-world security dataset
